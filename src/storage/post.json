Patil Technical Campus,\nVarale-Talegaon, Pune .\nSubject: Permission to Organize Workshop and Zonal Competition in Collaboration with IIT Bombay\nRespected Sir/Madam,\nI request your kind permission to organize a technical workshop in collaboration with IIT Bombay, followed by a zonal-level competition at our campus. The event will be limited to 200 participants, as the final stage involves a Robotics Bot Competition with provided materials. After the workshop, the zonal competition will be conducted by our college faculty under IIT Bombay’s initiative.\nA team of three IITians will visit our campus to guide the sessions, and the winning team of four students will receive certificates and a direct entry to IIT Bombay’s Tech Fest, which otherwise requires multiple selection rounds. This event will provide great exposure and bring recognition to our institute.\nI sincerely request your approval to conduct this workshop and competition under the banner of Dr. D. Y. Patil Technical Campus, Pune.\nThanking you,\nPresident\nDeveloper Student Club\nDYPTC\nPawar Abhinav Sujit\nPresident, DSC\nProf. Nishiket Bansode\nFaculty Coordinator, DSC",

      "title": "🏥 Rural Healthcare IVR + AI Triage System (Your SIH Project)",
      "content": "1️⃣ Problem You’re Solving\nRural patients don’t have smartphones/internet → can’t use telemedicine apps.\nDoctors are few, and small cases overload big hospitals.\nNo real-time triage: Everyone goes to hospital → time & money wasted.\nMedicine availability unknown → patients travel, then find “not available”.\nEmergency delay → ambulances not auto-alerted.\n2️⃣ Your Solution (MVP)\nA phone call based AI assistant (IVR system) that:\nTalks to patient in local language via normal call.\nAsks yes/no or simple questions about symptoms.\nAI model decides:\nMild → give medicine info.\nModerate → doctor review.\nSevere → alert doctor + 108 ambulance.\nSends doctor dashboard + SMS alerts.\nShows medicine availability (mock/real database).\n3️⃣ Architecture (Step by Step)\n🔹 Input Layer (Voice Capture)\nPatient calls a toll-free number (IVR).\nSystem records patient’s voice.\n🛠 Tools:\nTwilio / Exotel / Airtel IVR API → to get calls from rural users.\nWhisper (STT model) → convert speech to text.\n🔹 AI Triage Layer (Decision Making)\nPatient’s text symptoms → sent to AI model.\nAI decides severity using rules + ML model.\n🛠 Tools:\nLLM: openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B or baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B.\nPrompting: Simple prompt like\n“If patient has fever + chest pain → severe, else if mild fever → mild.”\n🔹 Knowledge / Medicine Availability\nAI checks if medicine is available.\n🛠 Tools:\ngoogle/embeddinggemma-300m → store medicine + pharmacy info.\nSmall mock database of Jan Aushadhi medicines.\n🔹 Output Layer (Response Back)\nAI generates response → converted into speech.\nSystem plays back voice response to patient.\n🛠 Tools:\nText-to-Speech (TTS):\nResembleAI/chatterbox (good for IVR)\nor microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B\n🔹 Doctor Dashboard\nSimple web app showing:\nPatient symptoms\nAI severity label (green/yellow/red)\nMedicine suggested\nEmergency flag (red case → SMS doctor + 108 ambulance).\n🛠 Tools:\nFrontend: React.js / simple HTML dashboard.\nBackend: Flask / FastAPI (Python).\nDatabase: SQLite or Firebase (for hackathon demo).\n4️⃣ End-to-End Flow (Example)\nPatient dials IVR number.\n“Namaste, aapko kya problem hai? Bukhaar hai?”\nPatient: “Haan, 2 din se bukhaar hai, saath me saans lene me dikkat.”\nSTT → converts to text.\nAI triage → “Fever + breathing issue = Severe case”.\nDashboard → Doctor sees RED alert + patient details.\nSMS → Patient: “Please go to nearest hospital, ambulance is on the way.”\nTTS → speaks to patient in Hindi/Marathi with instructions.\nIf medicine needed → AI checks Jan Aushadhi DB → sends nearest availability info.\n5️⃣ Tech Stack (Final Recommendation)\nLayer\nTool/Model\nCall Handling\nTwilio / Exotel IVR\nSpeech-to-Text (STT)\nWhisper (OpenAI)\nTranslation (if needed)\ntencent/Hunyuan-MT-7B\nAI Triage (LLM)\nopenbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B\nEmbeddings DB\ngoogle/embeddinggemma-300m\nText-to-Speech (TTS)\nResembleAI/Chatterbox OR VibeVoice\nBackend\nFlask/FastAPI\nDashboard\nReact.js / Simple HTML\nAlerts (SMS/108)\nTwilio SMS API / Manual trigger\n6️⃣ Demo Plan for Hackathon\nStep 1: Patient (judge) calls IVR demo number.\nStep 2: System asks 2–3 symptom questions (Hindi/English).\nStep 3: Judge answers.\nStep 4: AI classifies case (mild/moderate/severe).\nStep 5: Dashboard updates live with judge’s details.\nStep 6: System plays back doctor’s advice in voice.\nStep 7: Optional → Show medicine DB search or ambulance SMS.\n7️⃣ Why This is a Strong SIH Idea\nSocial Impact: Directly solves rural healthcare access.\nTech Innovation: Uses AI + IVR + voice models (unique combo).\nScalability: Works on basic phones, not just smartphones.\nHackathon Friendly: You can demo with mock DB + Twilio trial.",
